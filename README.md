## Server Actions

The project utilizes Next.js server actions for various functionalities:

### Favorites Management

**`addOrRemoveFromFavorites`**

- **Purpose**: Adds or removes drivers and teams from a user's favorites
- **Parameters**:
  - `type`: String indicating the type ('driver' or 'team')
  - `id`: String ID of the driver or team to add/remove
- **Returns**: Updated user metadata or error message
- **Authentication**: Requires logged-in user
- **Usage Example**:

  ```typescript
  // Direct function call example
  const result = await addOrRemoveFromFavorites('team', 'mercedes');

  // Real implementation example from AddRemoveFavorites component
  <TableCell>
    <AddRemoveFavorites className="border-none" type="driver" id={driver.id} />
  </TableCell>;

  // The AddRemoveFavorites component uses React's useOptimistic for immediate UI updates:
  const handleSubmit = async (id: string, type: string) => {
    changeOptimisticIsFavorite(!optimisticIsFavorite);
    startTransition(async () => {
      await addOrRemoveFromFavorites(type, id);
      await user?.reload();
    });
  };
  ```

## View Transitions

The project implements Next.js experimental View Transitions API for smooth, animated page transitions:

### Driver Image Transitions

- **Components**:
  - `PositionTable.tsx`: Creates a smooth transition when navigating from home to driver-info pages
  - `DriverImageSection.tsx`: Maintains image continuity when viewing driver profiles
  - `TeamDriversSection.tsx`: Animates transitions between team and driver pages

### Implementation

The project uses the unstable_ViewTransition component from React to wrap elements that should transition between pages:

```tsx
import { unstable_ViewTransition as ViewTransition } from 'react';

// Example usage
<ViewTransition name={`driver-image-${driver.id}`}>
  <Image src={driver.image} alt={driver.name} width={200} height={200} />
</ViewTransition>;
```

## Authentication

The project includes a complete authentication system with the following features:

- User registration (sign-up)
- User login (sign-in)
- Protected routes for authenticated users
- Custom layout for authentication pages
